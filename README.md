# Water Quality Sampling Data

This will hopefully become a web application to publish water quality data in the Mid Peninsula region of the San Francisco Bay Area

To contribute please adhere to the following guidelines:

## Commit message format

Commit messages should follow this example format:

    [feat](changedFile.ext, otherFile.ext) add code to files

### Type
- The type should be enclosed in brackets.

#### Types
- [feat]  An added feature
- [fix]  A bug fix
- [docs]  Changes to documentation only (ie. add README.md)
- [style]  Changes to css styles
- [refactor]  Code change, not fixing a bug or adding features (ie. code cleanup, optimization)
- [test]  Add or improve tests
- [chore]  Changes to build tools, libraries, auto-generated resources

### Scope
- The scope (file or files changed) should be in parentheses.

### Subject
- After scope leave a space and then write the subject of the commit message.
- Use imperative present tense in your commit message.
- No need to capitalize the first letter (not a big deal if you do).
- No need for a period at the end (not a big deal if you add it).
- If the commit message doesn't fit on the subject line that's okay but try to have at least one small summarizing sentence to start out with.
